/**
 * Cross-module TanStack Query key registry.
 *
 * Each feature module owns its own key factory (`workspaceKeys`,
 * `discoverKeys`, …) for its PRIVATE cache slice. But the ESLint
 * sibling-module boundary means a module cannot import another module's
 * factory, so when one module's mutation must invalidate ANOTHER module's
 * cache the old options were both bad: a raw `['module', …]` literal that
 * silently rots, or over-broad invalidation.
 *
 * This registry owns the few CROSS-CUTTING roots — the contract surface a
 * sibling module legitimately needs to invalidate — so each such key is
 * defined exactly once. The owning module re-uses the root here as the prefix
 * of its own factory, and any other module invalidates through this registry
 * instead of a literal. Renaming a key is then a compile error at every
 * call-site, and the `no-restricted-syntax` lint rule (see eslint.config.js)
 * stops new raw cross-module literals from creeping back in.
 *
 * Module-PRIVATE keys do NOT belong here — keep them in the module's own
 * factory. Add a root here only when a different module must reference it.
