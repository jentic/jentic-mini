"""Unit tests for the response-size cap enforced mid-stream by the HTTP runner (§08 E2.4).

A body over ``max_response_bytes`` aborts **mid-stream** with
``UpstreamResponseTooLargeError`` (502) — before the whole oversized body is
buffered — so a hostile/large upstream can't OOM the instance. A body at/under
the cap passes verbatim, and a cap of 0 disables the check.
