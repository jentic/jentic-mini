"""Integration tests for worker job durability (§09 E4.2) against a real DB.

Covers the visibility-timeout recovery, retry-with-backoff requeue, dead-letter
budget, and that a healthy claim stamps a future visibility deadline + attempts.
Per the repo's no-DB-mocking rule these run against the real admin DB.
