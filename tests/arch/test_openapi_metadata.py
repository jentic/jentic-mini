"""Enforce that every generated operation carries the spec metadata catalogue.

The control-plane spec is generated from the FastAPI app (see
``tools/openapi_export``). For that generated document to stay
reference-quality, every operation a new route adds must come with the metadata
the shared meta modules provide:

- ``operationId`` + ``summary`` + a non-empty ``tags`` (see
  ``jentic_one.shared.web.openapi_meta``), and
- the standard RFC 9457 error envelope (``400``/``500``/``503``) supplied by
  ``include_router(..., responses=COMMON_ERROR_RESPONSES)`` from
  ``jentic_one.shared.web.openapi_responses``.

These tests fail when a new or changed route ships without that metadata,
pointing the author at the meta modules. They
complement the drift test in ``test_openapi_conformance.py`` (which catches a
spec that wasn't regenerated). The spec is built once per session via the
``generated_control_spec`` fixture.
